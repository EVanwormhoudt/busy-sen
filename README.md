# Busy'sen

3rd year project of one week by a group of 8 people

The main goal was to make a room planning for our school, that can display which room are and will be occupied, so that you can use them.


Made with native html/css/js for the front, and Node.js for the back-end;

Worked with a REST API, and a mongoDB database.
